# Overview
## Role - Gameplay Programmer (Coatsink)

# Key Contributions
- Implemented multiple cinematics sequences in Unity using Visual Scripting, Timeline, and internal tools.
- Improved designer workflows by identifying bottlenecks and programming faster, cleaner solutions for cinematic and RPG interactions.
- Developed features for an open RPG-style “Town Hub”, including conversation triggers, proximity interactions, and state-driven behaviours.
- Integrated and maintained Wwise music events across the project, ensuring correct playback, transitions, and audio logic.
- Designed VR-friendly interaction transitions, including smooth handovers when NPCs pass items (e.g., paper handoff sequences).
- Collaborated closely with design, narrative, and audio teams to solve cross-discipline implementation issues.

# Cinematics Implementation
I was responsible for assembling and implementing cinematics using a combination of Unity Visual Scripting, Timeline, and custom tooling. 
This included sequencing animations, triggering dialogue, synchronising events, and ensuring transitions worked smoothly in VR. 
I also improved various internal workflows to help designers build scenes faster and more reliably.

# Workflow & Tool Improvements
Across production, I proactively identified slow or fragile workflows—especially in cinematic setup and RPG town interactions. 
I built programming solutions to streamline these tasks, improving iteration speed for the design team. 
This included simplifying trigger systems, improving scripting behaviours, and refactoring logic to be more maintainable.

# RPG Town Systems
I contributed features to the game’s open RPG-style hub area, implementing multiple conversation triggers, interaction states, and flow logic. 
This included proximity-based events, branching interaction logic, and integration with narrative systems.

# Audio Integration
Handled the implementation and ongoing maintenance of Wwise music events, ensuring correct playback, transitions, looping logic, and sync with cinematic or interactive moments. 
Worked closely with audio designers to troubleshoot timing or event-trigger issues.

# VR Interaction Work
VR cinematics required careful handling to avoid disorientation. 
I helped design smoother interaction transitions—particularly around scenes where NPCs hand items to the player—ensuring they felt natural in a VR environment without causing clipping or abrupt motion.

# Final Thoughts
Worked cross-discipline with designers, narrative teams, audio, and producers, acting as a bridge between technical implementation and creative intent. Frequently took ownership of broken workflows or complex scenes, delivering fixes quickly and helping improve the overall cinematic pipeline for the project.
