Role - Gameplay Programmer (Coatsink)

# Key Contributions
- Integrated Steam Achievements using the Steamworks API, including event triggering and achievement unlocking logic.
- Developed various debugging and developer tools, including memory leak detection utilities and internal testing tools.
- Built and maintained in-game UI elements using the in-house engine’s custom UI framework.
- Created a censoring system driven by a custom Regex ruleset to filter offensive language.
- Developed a bug report and feedback submission tool using Visual Basic for QA and internal use.
- Contributed to engine-level programming and feature fixes within the in-house engine.

# Steamworks Integration
Implemented the full Steam Achievements pipeline, wiring gameplay events to achievement triggers via the Steamworks API. 
This included handling callbacks, validating logic flow, and ensuring correct achievement states across sessions.

# Debugging Tools & Memory Work
Built internal tools for identifying memory leaks and improving debugging workflows. 
This involved working at a lower level within the in-house engine to track allocations, log behaviour, and expose debugging data for the dev team.

# UI Systems
Designed and implemented multiple UI elements in the in-house UI system — including menus, HUD components, and interactive screens. 
Worked closely with designers to ensure behaviour matched intended UX despite engine limitations.

# Censor Tool (Regex-Based)
Created a data-driven censor system using a custom Regex file to detect and filter offensive language. 
Designed the Regex pattern set and implemented the logic for real-time filtering and sanitisation within player-facing systems.

# Bug Report / Feedback Tool
Developed a standalone bug-reporting window in Visual Basic, allowing QA and internal testers to submit reports, attach logs, and send feedback directly to the team.

# Engine-Level Contributions
Fixed engine-side bugs, improved internal features, and supported the pipeline for UI, tools, and gameplay systems inside the custom Coatsink engine.

# Final Thoughts
Served as a bridge between designers, QA, and engineering by providing tools, debugging support, and improvements to internal workflows. 
Frequently took initiative on identifying issues and building small but impactful tools that sped up development.
