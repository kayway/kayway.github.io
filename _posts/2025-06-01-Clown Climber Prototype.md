A quirky stealth-climbing prototype involving climbing systems, enemy AI, and comedic abilities like pies, banana peels, and whoopie cushions.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented enemy AI using the provided behaviour tree framework.
- Created abilities:
  - Throwing pies
  - Placing banana peels that affect enemies
  - Exploding whoopie cushion as an area-based distraction
- Integrated abilities into the client’s existing climbing and animation systems.

# Additional Notes
The client initially wanted two climbing frameworks merged. 
After testing, I found they were incompatible, so I advised using one—saving development time and improving stability.
