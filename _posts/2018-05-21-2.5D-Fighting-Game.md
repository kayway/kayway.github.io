# Overview
This is a 2.5D Fighting game and my first game I made.It was made to investigate environmental influences in fighting games and whether that can break immersion in this genre. 
The goal was to simply beat the other character. Creating falling rocks that could kill the player or the enemy. I had to gather user feedback and create a thesis discussing this problem.
#AI
This was my first step into unreal AI, it can chase and attack the player.
It jump over the obstacles using nav links which does what the name implies and creates a link between gaps of a navigation mesh allowing the AI to take that path.
