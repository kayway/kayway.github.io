A prototype simulating realistic train physics and a puzzle loop involving moving cargo carts between trains.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented train physics, including movement, coupling, and track following.
- Designed and implemented the complete puzzle gameplay loop.
- Built puzzle UI for selecting, moving, and placing train carts.
- Created a track and train system using Unity’s spline tools.

# Additional Notes
The project used simple shapes and placeholders to focus on gameplay and physics accuracy rather than visuals.
