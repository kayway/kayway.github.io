A prototype simulating realistic train physics and a puzzle loop where you need to either take the carrages from the arriving trains or give them certain sequence of carrages.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented train physics, including movement, coupling, and track following.
- Designed and implemented the complete puzzle gameplay loop.
- Built puzzle UI For displaying required carrages for the train.

# Gameplay
Have a spawn system that waits for the player to fulfil the conditions before despawning and spawning the next train. 
The UI below shows the requirements for the current train and the next train letting you plan accordingly.

# Physics
Using Unity rigidbody system and spline system, we would have a train with configurable joints on the end to act as the coupler for the carrages. 
By pressing A and D you can switch the tracks when near a junction.

# Final Thoughts
This was a fun little project which allowed me to dabble into some fun train physics calculating the track restrictions and making sure the trains felt like trains.
