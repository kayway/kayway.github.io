- Enemy AI will hunt you down and attack from a safe distance, take out the gateways to stop them spawning 
- Towers absorb all fire turning the energy to rapid fire lasers or even a mega laser bomb
- Watch your health and energy as they can go down quick, always keep it up by going over the coloured pads
# Overview
This is a twin stick bullet hell game. You are a alien ship that crash landed on this planet but got captured by the governing authorities and researched your technology to develop their own military strength.
This was my attempt at a bullet hell game jam so think of it as a prototype as im working on a fully fleshed out game.
