# Details
This is a twin stick bullet hell game; you are a alien ship that crash landed on this planet but got captured by the governing authorities and researched your technology to develop their own military strength.
This was my attempt at a bullet hell game jam but failed to complete on time. Think of it as a prototype as im working on a fully fleshed out game.
