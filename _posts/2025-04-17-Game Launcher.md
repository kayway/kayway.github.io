A simple game launcher where clicking designated pages in a book launches different games.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented launch functionality for loading different game executables from within Unity.
- Integrated the system with the client’s animated book UI and page-turning assets.

# Additional Notes
This was pretty easy to implement just exposed a variable where the client can set a path to the executable he wanted that page to launch and then it would execute Process.Start. 
A very small project but was a fun one to implement.
