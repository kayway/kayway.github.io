# Details
This is a 3D Fighting game and my first game i made. It was meant to be a prototype for the full release but having going through the development cycle made me realise the monumental task of solo developing this.
There is a single player and a local multiplayer mode but only one level where you have to defeat all the enemies or collect all the pumpkins in the level.
