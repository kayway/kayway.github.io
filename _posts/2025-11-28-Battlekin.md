# Overview
## Role - Gameplay Programmer (Coatsink)

# Key Contributions
- Implemented tutorial steps guiding players through core mechanics.
- Developed multiple UI overlays supporting gameplay feedback and onboarding.
- Created dialogue boxes and integrated them into the game's interaction flow.
- Collaborated with designers to ensure pacing and clarity in tutorial and UI elements.

# Gameplay Systems
I implemented step-based tutorial logic to introduce players to the game’s core mechanics. 
This included scripting onboarding sequences, managing progression state, and ensuring players received clear visual and textual cues.

# UI/UX
Built UI overlays and dialogue box systems using Horizon’s tools, focusing on clarity and responsiveness. 
This included dynamic UI elements triggered by gameplay events and appropriate timing for prompts, dialogue, and feedback.

# Scripting & Collaboration
Worked in Horizon Worlds’ scripting environment to support designers and iterate quickly on gameplay and UI ideas. 
Ensured tutorial and dialogue flows were reliable and easy to adjust during development.

# Final Thoughts
Currently working on this project, It has been a challenge dealing with its engine and its clowd based development.
