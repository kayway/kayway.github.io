# Details
This was a University group project to redesign a website for a client. One of the client's requirements was to use the software package website x5. 
I was responsible for organizing meetings with the client and to do the majority of the discussion with the client while relaying the client's requirements to the team.
The biggest problem was using website x5, as it was a new software package for me and was pretty inflexible with custom styles. Little actual code was used as the software seldom allowed it.
This was a great experience for not only developing my teamwork and organization skills, but talking with a client and understanding the requirements from a client can often not be changed. What I mean by this is when I talked with the client he was adamant for using website x5 as he had a understanding on how to use it and it was a packaged deal with the domain. I would go as far to so that we could of done it easier using pure code from scratch, but the clients requirements come first.
