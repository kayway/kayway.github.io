A Unity prototype inspired by The Last of Us, focusing on melee combat, targeting, AI encounters, and traversal systems. 
The client provided 3D animations and assets; I implemented all underlying systems.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented a third-person camera with targeting and tracking behaviour.
- Built a full combat system including attacks, hit detection, and reactions.
- Created enemy AI with patrol, detect, chase, and attack behaviours.
- Added a health and damage system for both player and enemies.

# Additional Notes
The client had changed his mind on some features so later in the project I had to modify/add the following features:
- A point-and-click movement system with a UI trail indicating traversable paths.
- Attack/Use Item UI during path selection.
- Enemy AI updates enabling enemies to spot and attack the player during traversal.
