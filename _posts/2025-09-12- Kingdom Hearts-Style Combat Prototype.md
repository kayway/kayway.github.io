# Overview
A Unity prototype inspired by Kingdom Hearts, featuring action-combat, crowd-handling, and multiple AI behaviours using two client-provided frameworks plus Emerald AI.

# Key Contributions
- Implemented player character combat behaviour, integrating two separate combat frameworks.
- Built enemy AI using Emerald AI, tuned for crowd-handling to prevent overwhelming the player.
- Integrated both frameworks’ health and damage systems, ensuring compatibility and consistent behaviour.

# Additional Features
This project required careful framework integration and conflict resolution to ensure stable combat across multiple systems.
