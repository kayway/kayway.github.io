Hi, I'm Kieran, a gameplay and systems programmer with experience across Unity, Unreal, and custom in-house engines. 
I enjoy building clean, reliable gameplay systems, solving technical problems, and supporting designers with tools and workflow improvements. 
I’m especially motivated by projects that combine technical depth with strong player experience.

# What I specialise In
- Gameplay programming (C++, C#, Blueprint & Visual Scripting)
- AI behaviours, interaction systems, and combat prototyping
- UI systems & user flow (both runtime and tools-side)
- Tools development, debugging, and workflow optimisation
- VR interaction, cinematics, and system integration

# Professional Background
I've worked as a Gameplay Programmer at Coatsink, contributing to multiple VR and non-VR projects including Batman Arkham Shadow, Men in Black: Most Wanted, and Astronimo (built on an in-house engine). My responsibilities ranged from gameplay systems and AI, to cinematics implementation, tool development, debugging, localisation fixes, audio integration (Wwise), and Steam API work.

Alongside professional work, I develop prototypes in Unreal and Unity, take part in game jams, and complete freelance gameplay systems and tools commissions.

# How I Work
I enjoy breaking down problems, understanding systems deeply, and creating solutions that are both maintainable and designer-friendly. 
I focus on writing clean, clear code, improving development workflows, and communicating effectively with cross-discipline teams. 
I like owning features end-to-end and making sure they’re robust and intuitive for players and for the team.


# Outside of Work
I love Hosting servers, weird hobby but its fun to tweak things to your way and playing it with others. I also like gaming if that wasn't obvious, my favorite of all time is "Elder Scrolls:Oblivion". Right now I'm into "Guild Wars 2" and "Mount and Blade: Bannerlord".
I also Hike weekly as I live in a great place for it and I enjoy electronic repair, fixing stuff up whether its for a friend or myself is enjoyable for me.
