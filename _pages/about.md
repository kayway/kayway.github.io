# Hobbies
I love Hosting servers, weird hobby but its fun to tweak things to your way and playing it with others. I also like gaming if that wasn't obvious, my favorite of all time is "Elder Scrolls:Oblivion". Right now I'm into "Guild Wars 2" and "Mount and Blade: Bannerlord".
I also Hike weekly as I live in a great place for it and I enjoy electronic repair, fixing stuff up whether its for a friend or myself is enjoyable for me.
