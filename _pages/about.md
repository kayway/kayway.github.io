# Details 

## Hobbies
I love Hosting servers, wierd hobby but its fun to tweak things to your way and playing it with others. I also like gaming if that wasnt obvious, my favorite of all time is "Elder Scrolls:Oblivion". Right now I'm into "Guild Wars 2" and "Mount and Blade: Bannerlord".
I also Hike weekly as I live in a great place for it and I enjoy electronic repair, fixing stuff up whether its for a friend or myself is enjoyable for me. 
## How I Started
My passion for Game and mod development came from my passion for playing games, but one thing in particular that made me start on this path is when me and my friends where talking about how we would be in a fighting game; things like what moves we would have and would we be the good or bad guys. I was already doing my computer science degree at the time so I though "Hey,I would love to make that!!" and thinking it couldnt be too hard considering I already knew some programming I dived into Unreal Engine, my first game editor. Oh how naive I was, You can still find the project on here with all the details so I wont go into the details but that idea helped me learn the development cycle and challenges developing a game brings. Furthermore, it made me like making games even more, seeing the reaction of my friends and family playing it and just seeing the work however poorly complete just amazed me.
## What I'm Currently Doing
Right now I am just doing what i love making games, Currently also working on a fully custom [FiveM]{https://fivem.net} server Check back for updates on that.
